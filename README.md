# PSO Platform Benchmarks
This repository contains implementations of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in a number of different languages, using a variety of libraries and tools.

The intention is to compare functional style implementation of the algorithm according to a number of a factors, including: readability, maintainability, maturity of ecosystem, ease of use and performance.

## Implementation
The algorithm implemented is the synchronous modified gbest PSO with the inertia term as per:
